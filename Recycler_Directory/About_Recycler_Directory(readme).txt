Overview

This project addresses a real-world regulatory data challenge involving industrial recycler directories and hazardous waste annual returns submitted through government portals.

The source data is heterogeneous, inconsistent, and structurally complex, making it unsuitable for direct reporting, analysis, or regulatory review.
This framework converts raw submissions into clean, validated, audit-ready datasets through reproducible, programmatic workflows.

Why This Is Data Science (Not Just Scripting)

This work demonstrates:

i. Problem framing under messy real-world constraints

ii. Data integrity preservation during aggressive cleaning

iii. Reproducibility and transparency

iv. Domain awareness (environmental compliance, FY logic, regulatory structure)

v. Scalable logic that can be reused across years and datasets

The focus is not on tools, but on decision-safe data transformation.
